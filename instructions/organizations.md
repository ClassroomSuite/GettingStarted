# GitHub Organizations
Organizations are shared accounts where businesses and open-source projects can collaborate across many projects at
once. Owners and administrators can manage member access to the organization's data and projects with sophisticated 
security and administrative features.

## Recommendations
* You should use multiple GitHub organizations to hold different kinds of repositories:
    * one or more for assignments/exercises (template repositories)
    * one per classroom to hold student repositories
    * one to hold other repositories such as tools for plagiarism, managing student repos, etc.

## Steps
1. [Start creating an organization](https://help.github.com/en/github/setting-up-and-managing-organizations-and-teams/creating-a-new-organization-from-scratch)
2. Choose the Free plan
    * You may later request [school/teacher benefits](https://education.github.com/benefits/offers) 
2. Name your organization
3. Associate your organization
    *  with your personal GitHub account (Recommended)
    *  with a business or institution
4. For organizations with student repositories, make sure that [member base permissions](https://docs.github.com/en/github/setting-up-and-managing-organizations-and-teams/setting-base-permissions-for-an-organization) is set to None. This will make sure students are unable to view private repositories they don't have direct access to such as assignments from others.
