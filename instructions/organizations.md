# GitHub Organizations
Organizations are shared accounts where businesses and open-source projects can collaborate across many projects at
once. Owners and administrators can manage member access to the organization's data and projects with sophisticated 
security and administrative features.

## Recommendations
* You should use multiple GitHub organizations to hold different kinds of repositories:
    * one or more for assignments/exercises (template repositories)
    * one per classroom to hold student repositories
    * one to hold other repositories such as tools for plagiarism, managing student repos, etc.
