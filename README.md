# Getting started

## 1. Setting up GitHub
1. Create your [GitHub organizations](instructions/organizations.md)
2. Create your [GitHub classrooms](instructions/classrooms.md)
3. Create your [assignments and exercises](instructions/assignments.md)
4. Download [Classroom Assitant Desktop App](https://classroom.github.com/assistant) 
    * Makes it easy to clone all students repos into a desired destination folder
    * However, you might alternatively want to use [GitHub Actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions) and [GitHub REST API](https://docs.github.com/en/rest) to accomplish tasks (e.g.: correction, plagiarism scanning, etc.)
4. Create your [Firebase project and database](instructions/firebase.md)
