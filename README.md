# Getting started

## Steps
1. Create your [GitHub organizations](instructions/organizations.md)
2. Create your [GitHub classrooms](instructions/classrooms.md)
3. Create your [assignments](instructions/assignments.md) and [exercises](instructions/exercises.md)
4. Download [Classroom Assitant Desktop App](https://classroom.github.com/assistant) 
    * Makes it easy to clone all students repos into a desired destination folder
    * However, you might instead want to use [GitHub Actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions) and [GitHub REST API](https://docs.github.com/en/rest) to accomplish tasks (e.g.: correction, plagiarism scanning, etc.)
5. Create your [Firebase project and database](instructions/firebase.md)
    * This for viewing student autograding results in real time during class exercises.
6. [Grade student assignments](instructions/grading_assignments.md)
